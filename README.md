# Auction-Prop-Site-Styling

/// THIS IS THE STYLING OF THE AUCTION-PROP WEBSITE FOR 2021 \\\

This will serve as a guideline of what all pages on the site should look like. this is also all the pages that will be used on the site for now. Ekstra pages like the 404 Error
page and various other error and message pages will come later.

This will just help you to understand the site, all of its pages and the styling involved.

Ofcourse the "SUBMIT PROPERTY" page, will ofcourse look different and include all the fields that Gabriel has been working on. That goes for the Register page as well.

The profile page, will contain all the user information etc. and if we can style it to look the same as the rest of the site. That would be great.

"Properties Details Page" This is the landing page for each individual property. And all the information that was supplied when you created a listing for auction on the
"SUBMIT PROPERTY" page, will be pulled through to this page. To give a user more information on each property. And also to click on the "BID ON THIS PROPERTY" button
That should take him to the "Auction Room" to bid on that property. If he registered as a "Buyer", paid his auction deposit and the auction is ofcourse active or running.

If at all possible, if Gabriel can assist in making the the forms on the "Contact Us" page to work as well as the one in the footer. That would be great, i believe it's just PHP
that needs to be written or added. I'm not sure

Should there be any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.

JP Herbst
